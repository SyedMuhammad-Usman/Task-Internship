Introduction
My name is Syed Muhammad Usman, and I am currently a student of Software Engineering at COMSATS University, Abbotabad, in my 5th semester. My studies have provided me with a solid foundation in computer science, and I'm eager to continue building upon this knowledge.
Throughout my academic journey, I have studied several key areas within software engineering. These include:
Programming Fundamentals and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java24. These courses equipped me with the basic principles of software development and the ability to create modular, reusable code.
Data Structures provided me with the knowledge to organize and manage data efficiently, which is crucial for developing scalable and performant applications2.
Web Development has allowed me to explore the world of creating interactive and dynamic websites2.
Databases and Computer Networking: I've gained a foundational understanding of data storage, retrieval, and network communication
